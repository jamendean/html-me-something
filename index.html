            <h2>My Work Summary</h2>
        </header>
        <p> For more than three years, I've worked in the digital space. Much of that time, I've curated, aggregated and written content for social media.</p> 
            
        <p>In the past year, I've focused my efforts on learning more about search engine marketing, programmatic display and pre-roll video. I've familiarized myself with the logistics of copywriting, and enjoy writing ad copy for businesses. I've dabbled in SEO and am obsessed with DoubleClick.</p> 
            
        <p>I have a naturally curious personality. I will find answers and present them concisely. I've learned that if information isn't supported by data, it's worthless.</p>
            
        <p>Contradictory to my journalistic nature, I'm exploring a master's degree in computer science. I am incredibly interested in front-end and back-end development and am more than happy to talk about it. Thanks to my current role, I've adopted an analytical mindset - akin to clinicians.</p>
